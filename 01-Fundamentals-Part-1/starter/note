we have 7 primitive DATA-TYPES: 

1. number    : floating point numbers
2. string    : sequence of characters used for text
3. boolean   : logical type can be true or false
4. undefined : values taken by variables that is not yet defined
5. null      : also means 'empty value'
6. symbol    : value that is unique and cannot be changed
7. BigInt    : larger integer than the number type can hold



javascrript has DYNAMIC TYPING: we do not have ti manually define the data type of the variable. instead, data types are determined automatically
