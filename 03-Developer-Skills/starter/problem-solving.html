4 STEPS TO SOLVE ANY PROBLEMS 1. make sure you 100% understand the problem. Ask
the right questions to get a clear picture of the problem. 2. Divide and
conquer: Break a big problem into smaller sub-problems. 3. Don't be afraid to do
as much research as you have to 4. for bigger problems, write pseudo-code before
writing the actual code
